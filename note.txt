.next/

This is a generated folder that Next.js uses during development and for the build output. You typically don't need to interact with this directory directly, and it's often added to .gitignore since you don't need to commit it to your version control.

node_modules/

This is where your npm packages live after you run npm install. It contains all the dependencies required by your project.

app/

This directory replaces the traditional "pages" folder in Next.js setups. It contains all your application's pages. Each JavaScript file in this directory becomes a route in the app.

page.js

This file replaces the default index.js and acts as the starting page of the app. It corresponds to the / route.

layout.js

This is a root layout component. Layout components are used to maintain consistent structures and styles across different pages in your application. This can encompass elements like headers, footers, and side navigation.

public/

Static files (like images) are served from here. Any file inside this folder is mapped to / and can be accessed directly, like /favicon.ico for the example provided.

next.config.js

This file allows you to set up custom configuration settings for your Next.js application. It's where you might set up environment variables, adjust Webpack configurations, or configure serverless deployment settings.

jsconfig.json

This file is used to configure certain behaviors in JavaScript files. It can be used in conjunction with editors like VS Code to specify compiler options, set up the module system, and define base paths for the project.

package.json

This file contains metadata about the project like its name, version, and dependencies. It's an essential part of any npm-based project.

README.md

A markdown file containing information about the project. By default, Next.js will give you a basic README, but you should update it with specifics about your project.
